The receptionist dashboard alone saved us hours — appointment booking, patient history, medication tracking, session context for returning clients. But the real value is the doctor's AI tool: take 4 photos of a patient's head and get follicle counts, donor area mapping, and transplant planning. We also use it to track progress at 7, 30, and 90 days post-transplant.",
