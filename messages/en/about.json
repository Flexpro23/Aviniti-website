    "label": "Our Story",
    "title": "From Getting Scammed to Building the Company",
    "name": "Ali Odat",
    "role": "Founder & CEO, Aviniti",
    "paragraph_1": "Before Aviniti, I was a field coordinator for World Vision — a Canadian NGO — at the Za'atari refugee camp in Jordan. I was the highest-ranking staff member on-site, managing four industrial kitchens, 24 employees, and 300 Syrian workers producing 20,000 meals a day. Good salary, great benefits, stable career. I'm a civil engineer by training. I had zero background in code.",
    "paragraph_2": "In 2018, I had an idea for a car services app — a platform where you could buy, finance, insure, and maintain your car all in one place, with built-in calculators for every bank and insurance company. I started looking for developers to build it. The first team said it would cost $60,000–$70,000. I had $15,000–$20,000. So I went offshore — India, Egypt, freelancers. I spent close to $9,000 across three different developers. Every single one stopped answering my calls. No product. No code. Nothing.",
    "paragraph_3": "The last developer I hired used Flutter, so I started learning the basics just to check his work. Then COVID hit. Three months in quarantine with nothing to do. I taught myself to code — religiously, every day. By 2021, I could build an app. Slow, full of bugs, but functional. I quit World Vision, started delivering perfume packages with a friend just to pay the bills, and kept coding. I caught the AI wave early — one of the first 10,000 ChatGPT users. I've been building with Google AI products since Gemini was still called Bard.",
    "paragraph_4": "I registered Aviniti in 2025. The company exists because I know exactly what it feels like to have an idea, spend your savings on developers who disappear, and have nothing to show for it. That's why we give you an AI-powered estimate before you spend a dollar, why we show you weekly progress, and why we don't ghost. Ever."
