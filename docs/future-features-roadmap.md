# Aviniti Website - Future Features Roadmap
**Created:** February 2026  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive list of potential enhancements for lead generation optimization

---

## 🎯 Lead Generation Enhancements

### 1. **Exit Intent Popups** ✅ *Added to PRD v3*
When users move to close the tab, trigger a targeted popup:
- "Wait! Get a free 15-minute consultation" 
- Offer a lead magnet (e.g., "10 AI App Ideas for Your Industry" PDF)
- Different offers based on which page they're leaving from

### 2. **Lead Magnets / Gated Content**
Create downloadable resources that capture emails:
- "The SMB Guide to AI Transformation" (eBook)
- "App Development Cost Calculator Spreadsheet"
- "2026 Mobile App Trends Report"
- Industry-specific guides (Healthcare AI, Retail AI, etc.)

### 3. **Progressive Profiling**
Instead of asking for everything upfront, gradually collect data:
- First visit: Just email
- Return visit: Company name, role
- Third interaction: Budget, timeline
- This reduces form abandonment significantly

### 4. **Micro-Conversions Throughout**
Add smaller conversion points before the big ask:
- "Get notified when we launch new solutions" (newsletter)
- "Save this estimate to your email"
- "Bookmark your Idea Lab results"
